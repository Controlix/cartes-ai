Sometimes a game should continue, even if a team has over 1000 points. This happens when
- both teams have the same score or,
- the last round ends with a litige
In the first case, an extra round must decide which teams wins. However no score will be added, both teams end with the same score.
I the second case, an extra round must decide to what team the reserve points should go. The points of the extra game must not be added to the score.
